## About me

I'm currently pursuing my MSc at the University of Toronto, where I work at the [Robot Vision and Learning Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu) under the supervision of professor [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/).

My more recent research interests are in automated planning and reasoning in robotics, specifically focused on task-and-motion planning problems. 

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer, at [Xero](https://www.xero.com) and [Hubdoc](https://www.hubdoc.com) focusing on applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
